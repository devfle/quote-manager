# Welcome to QuoteManager

[![Build and Test Quote Manager](https://github.com/devfle/quote-manager/actions/workflows/github-actions-demo.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/devfle/quote-manager/actions/workflows/github-actions-demo.yml)

With QuoteManager you have the ability to save and organize your sources for your term papers. All data is stored locally in the browser. I built the application so that I no longer have to manually insert every source into my term paper. This tool not only formats the sources correctly, but also puts them in the correct alphabetical order. This project was also a good opportunity to work with Typescript for the first time.

## For Developing

In theory, there is still a lot to do. I am happy about every pull request that brings additional functionalities or improvements. Thanks already at this point.

1. check out the project
2. run npm ci
3. run npm start

The following commands are supported:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
